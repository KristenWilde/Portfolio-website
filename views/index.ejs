    <h2>About Me:</h2>
    <p>Hello! I've enjoyed making websites in my spare time for several years, and am now seeking a full-time career as a developer. I'm excited to be in a field where I'll always be learning and growing.</p>
    <h4>How did I learn to code?</h4>
    <p>After trying various online courses and resources, I enrolled at <a href="http://launchschool.com">LaunchSchool.com</a>, a remote learning program which emphasizes mastery-based learning and fundamentals. I chose this program because I wanted to really understand what was going on in my code. The program gave me a lot of practice with skills such as systematic problem solving, consulting the docs, and debugging, and I gained a solid understanding of details such as variable scopes, closures, regular expressions, and <span class="code">this</span>. I was able to study about 20 hours per week while working part-time, and completed the core curriculum in 18 months.</p>
    <p>Since then, I've explored (and built my own projects) with various frameworks: Ruby on Rails, Vue.js, Express.js, and currently React.js. I'm excited to continue learning about these tools and others, and I'm eager to put my skills to work as part of a great team.</p>
    <h4>Why do I want to pursue this career?</h4>
    <p>I have always loved building and making things from scratch (where "scratch" is just about anything: paper, cloth, wood, musical sounds, or code). My love of coding began with an elective course (Web Publishing) that I took as I was working on my BA in music (playing viola--another challenging pursuit). Other priorities have taken me out of the full-time workforce for the past 11 years, but I'm ready to finally begin my career. I'd really like to be part of building things that help shape the future.</p>
    <h4>What makes me unique?</h4>
    <p>I'm a good listener, an open-minded thinker, and I'm passionate about quality. I tend to be quiet, but I'm not afraid to speak up or take charge when necessary. In fact, I have 20 years of experience pointing out people's mistakes (patiently, diplomatically, and encouragingly) as a music teacher. Because of this, I'd probably make a great team leader or manager.</p>
